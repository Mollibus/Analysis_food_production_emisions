# Analysis_food_production_Co2emissions
An exploratory analysis on datasets provided by FAO about international food production and relative Co2 equivalent gas emissions

The analysis is reported in a jupyter notebook (FabioMolliDataVis.ipynb), data is stored in three different .csv files

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations provides free access to food and agriculture data for over 245 countries and territories, from the year 1961 to the most recent update (depends on the dataset). One dataset from the FAO's database is the Food Balance Sheets. It presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period, the last time an update was loaded to the FAO database was in 2013. The food balance sheet shows for each food item the sources of supply and its utilization. This chunk of the dataset is focused on two utilizations of each food item available:

Food - refers to the total amount of the food item available as human food during the reference period.

Feed - refers to the quantity of the food item available for feeding to the livestock and poultry during the reference period.

This dataset was meticulously gathered, organized and published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Additional datasets report amount of Co2 equivalent emissions of food type prduction life cycle and greenhouse gas emissions by countries (1990-2015).
